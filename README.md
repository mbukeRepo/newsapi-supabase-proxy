## Supabase news-api proxy

This is a simple proxy for the newsapi.org API. It's a simple server that proxies requests to newsapi.org.

### Setup

These are the setup steps you can follow to setup the proxy on your own server.

1. Install the Supabase CLI: `npm install -g supabase`
2. Log in to the CLI using the command: `supabase login`
3. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/mbukeRepo/newsapi-supabase-proxy.git`
4. Link your local project to the remote Supabase project, like so: `supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>`

### Deploying

Run `supabase deploy <function-name>` to deploy the project to your Supabase project.

### Testing

To test these functions, you have to request for the resources using
this format: `https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co/<endpoint>`.

These are the endpoints generated by the functions:

| endpoint              | description               | query params                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| get-publishers        | Get articles by publisher | ?apiKey=[string]                              |
| get-articles-by-topic | Get articles by topic     | ?page=[string]&apiKey=[string]&topic=[string] |
| get-hot-articles      | Get top headlines         | ?page=[string]&apiKey=[string]                |

Note that to make a call to those endpoint you have add `Authorization` header with a value in this format `Bearer <anon key>` the anon key can be found on `https://app.supabase.com/project/<project refID>/settings/api`.
